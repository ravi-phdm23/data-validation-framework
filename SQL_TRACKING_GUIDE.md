# 🎯 **Transformation Validation with SQL Query Tracking**

## 📋 **Enhanced Features**

### **SQL Query Tracking**
Every transformation validation result now includes the **exact SQL query** that was executed to validate that specific row/scenario.

### **New Columns in Results:**

| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `SQL_Query_Used` | **Complete SQL query executed for validation** | `WITH transformed_data AS (SELECT customer_id, CONCAT(first_name, " ", last_name)...` |
| `Execution_Timestamp` | When the validation was executed | `2025-07-26 06:05:18` |
| `Details` | Human-readable validation results | `Transformation successful: 1000 rows processed` |
| `Validation_Status` | PASS/FAIL/INFO status | `PASS` |
| `Row_Count` | Number of rows processed | `1000` |
| `Percentage` | Success percentage | `100.0` |

## 🚀 **How to Use:**

### **1. Dashboard View:**
- **Scenario Details Table**: Now includes truncated SQL preview
- **SQL Query Viewer**: Select any scenario to view its complete SQL query
- **Expandable Sections**: Click on scenarios to see full SQL implementation

### **2. Excel Export:**
- **Main Results Sheet**: Contains all validation data + SQL_Query_Used column
- **SQL_Queries_Used Sheet**: Dedicated sheet with just scenario names and full SQL queries
- **Summary Sheet**: Executive overview with counts and statistics

### **3. Real-Time Validation:**
- Each executed scenario stores its SQL query
- SQL is generated dynamically based on derivation logic
- Full query history maintained for audit trail

## 📊 **Example SQL Tracking:**

### **Simple Transformation:**
```sql
-- Transformation Validation: full_name
-- Source Table: customers
-- Derivation Logic: CONCAT(first_name, " ", last_name)

WITH transformed_data AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        CONCAT(first_name, " ", last_name) as calculated_full_name
    FROM `cohesive-apogee-411113.banking_sample_data.customers`
),
validation_summary AS (
    SELECT 
        COUNT(*) as total_rows,
        COUNT(calculated_full_name) as non_null_rows
    FROM transformed_data
)
SELECT 
    'PASS' as validation_status,
    total_rows as row_count,
    ROUND(100.0, 2) as percentage,
    CONCAT('Transformation successful: ', CAST(total_rows AS STRING), ' rows processed') as details
FROM validation_summary
WHERE total_rows > 0
```

### **Aggregation Validation:**
```sql
-- Transformation Validation: total_amount
-- Source Table: transactions
-- Derivation Logic: SUM(amount)

WITH transformed_data AS (
    SELECT 
        account_number,
        SUM(amount) as calculated_total_amount
    FROM `cohesive-apogee-411113.banking_sample_data.transactions`
    GROUP BY account_number
),
validation_summary AS (
    SELECT 
        COUNT(*) as total_rows,
        COUNT(calculated_total_amount) as non_null_rows,
        MIN(calculated_total_amount) as min_value,
        MAX(calculated_total_amount) as max_value,
        AVG(CAST(calculated_total_amount AS FLOAT64)) as avg_value
    FROM transformed_data
)
SELECT 
    'PASS' as validation_status,
    total_rows as row_count,
    ROUND(100.0, 2) as percentage,
    CONCAT('Aggregation successful: ', CAST(total_rows AS STRING), ' rows processed') as details
FROM validation_summary
WHERE total_rows > 0
```

## 🎯 **Benefits:**

✅ **Full Transparency**: See exactly what SQL was executed for each validation  
✅ **Audit Trail**: Complete query history for compliance and debugging  
✅ **Reproducibility**: Can re-run the exact same SQL independently  
✅ **Learning Tool**: Understand how business logic translates to SQL  
✅ **Troubleshooting**: Debug failed validations by examining the SQL  
✅ **Documentation**: Export SQL queries for technical documentation  

## 📥 **Usage Instructions:**

1. **Upload Excel File**: Use the fixed Excel sample file
2. **Execute Scenarios**: Click "Execute All Excel Scenarios"
3. **View Results**: Go to "Data Visualization" tab
4. **Inspect SQL**: Use the "View SQL Queries Used" dropdown
5. **Export Data**: Download comprehensive validation report with SQL queries
6. **Audit Trail**: All SQL queries are preserved in the Excel export

## 🔍 **File Structure:**

```
Exported Excel File:
├── Executive_Summary (High-level metrics)
├── Scenario_Details (Detailed results with SQL preview)
├── SQL_Queries_Used (Complete SQL queries for each scenario)
└── All_Results_Data (Raw data with SQL_Query_Used column)
```

## 💡 **Pro Tips:**

- **SQL Review**: Always review the generated SQL before trusting results
- **Query Optimization**: Use the SQL column to optimize slow-running validations
- **Custom Modifications**: Copy SQL queries to create custom validation scripts
- **Performance Analysis**: Compare SQL execution times across scenarios
- **Documentation**: Use SQL queries as technical documentation for business rules
